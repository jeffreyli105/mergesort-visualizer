# mergesort-visualizer
Visualizer for Merge Sort Algorithm
This project is a visual representation of the Merge Sort algorithm, designed to help users understand how merge sort works step-by-step with real-time animations. The visualization dynamically renders an array of bars that represent the elements being sorted, giving users a clear view of how the algorithm divides and merges the array.

Features:
Dynamic Array Rendering: Visualizes the merge sort algorithm with animated bars representing elements of the array.

Interactive Controls: 

Includes two buttons:

Generate New Array: Generates a new random array of integers.

Merge Sort: Starts the merge sort algorithm and visualizes its sorting process in real-time.

Smooth Animations: Uses React state and lifecycle methods to smoothly animate the sorting process.

Responsive Design: The visualizer adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience across devices.

Technologies Used:
React: Used for rendering the UI and managing state during the animation.

JavaScript: Handles the sorting logic and array manipulation.

CSS: Styles the UI components for a clean and interactive user experience.
